# Credit-PSet
Python Solution to the MWD Credit Problem Set

Within this challenge we were instructed to create a program that can validate an input credit card number using Luhn's algorithm.
Concept: Create a Credit Card Validation system using Luhn's Algorithm
Tasks: Check my Card (Enter a Credit Card Number, return whether or not the number is valid), Import numbers to check (Take a file of credit card numbers, and line by line, validate each number), Generate Valid CC Nums (Take a number between 1-100, and add that many random credit card numbers to a file), Quit
The solution will be tested for robustness, so this is another sub-task (Validation).
